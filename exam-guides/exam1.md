## 1. Memory-performance gaps

The memory-performance gap, often referred to as the "memory wall", describes the growing disparity between the speed of CPU operations and the latency of memory access. As CPUs have continued to advance at a rapid pace, memory speeds have not kept up, leading to this widening gap. This section delves into the causes, implications, and potential solutions to this challenge.

![Diagram illustrating the memory-performance gap](imagesx1/memwall.png)


### Definition and Significance

- **Memory-Performance Gap**: The difference in growth rates between CPU processing speeds and memory access times. While CPU speeds have been doubling approximately every 18 months (following Moore's Law), memory latency has seen only modest improvements.
  
- **Significance**: As CPUs become faster, they often have to wait for data to be fetched from memory. This waiting period, or "stall", can significantly hamper the overall system performance, even if the CPU itself is highly efficient.

### Causes and Implications
- **Causes**:
  - **Technological Limitations**: Physical constraints in DRAM technology that limit the rate of improvements.
  - **Economic Factors**: The high cost of developing faster memory technologies can deter rapid advancements.
  - **Power Consumption**: Faster memory often requires more power, leading to thermal challenges.

- **Implications**:
  - **Stalled CPU Cycles**: The CPU spends a significant amount of time waiting for data from memory, leading to underutilization of its capabilities.
  - **Energy Inefficiency**: Waiting for memory consumes power without doing useful work, leading to wasted energy.
  - **System Bottlenecks**: The overall system performance can be bottlenecked by memory latency, regardless of how fast the CPU is.

### Solutions and Strategies

- **Caching**: Using small amounts of faster memory (cache) to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need to fetch data from main memory.
  
- **Prefetching**: Predictively loading data into cache before it's needed by the CPU.
  
- **Memory-Level Parallelism**: Accessing memory in parallel to hide latency. This refers to the ability of a processor to issue multiple memory operations (like loads and stores) to different memory locations in parallel. Instead of waiting for one memory operation to complete before starting the next, MLP allows for several memory operations to be in progress at the same time, thereby hiding or reducing the perceived memory latency.
  
- **Improved DRAM Technologies**: Developing new memory technologies that can offer faster access times, such as DDR4, DDR5, and beyond.
  
- **Near Data Processing**: Moving computation closer to where data is stored, such as processing-in-memory (PIM) techniques.

By understanding and addressing the memory-performance gap, architects and developers can design systems that make the most of both CPU and memory capabilities, leading to more efficient and performant computing systems.


## 2. DRAM & SRAM

Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) are two primary types of RAM used in computing systems. Each has its unique characteristics, advantages, and applications. This section provides an overview of both, highlighting their differences and use-cases.

### Definitions and Differences

- **DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)**:
  - **Definition**: A type of volatile (non-persistent) memory that stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - **Refresh Required**: The capacitors leak charge over time, so they need to be refreshed periodically.
    - **Slower Access Times**: Compared to SRAM, DRAM has slower access times.
    - **Lower Cost**: Generally cheaper to produce than SRAM.
    - **Higher Density**: Can store more data in the same amount of space compared to SRAM.

- **SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)**:
  - **Definition**: A type of volatile memory that uses bistable latching circuitry to store each bit.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - **No Refresh Required**: SRAM retains its data bits as long as power is supplied.
    - **Faster Access Times**: Offers quicker data access compared to DRAM.
    - **Higher Cost**: More expensive to produce due to its complexity.
    - **Lower Density**: Takes up more space for the same amount of data storage compared to DRAM.

### Applications and Use-Cases

- **DRAM**:
  - **Main Memory**: Often used as the primary memory in computing systems due to its cost-effectiveness and high storage capacity.
  - **Graphics RAM**: Used in graphics cards because of the need for large amounts of memory.

- **SRAM**:
  - **Cache Memory**: Due to its fast access times, SRAM is commonly used for CPU cache.
  - **On-Chip Memory**: Found on integrated circuits due to its speed.

### 2.a. Trade-Offs & Concepts

- **Speed vs. Power Consumption**: SRAM is faster but consumes more power, especially when idle. DRAM is slower but is more power-efficient during idle periods.
  
- **Cost vs. Capacity**: DRAM offers more storage capacity for a lower cost, while SRAM, being faster, is more expensive to produce.
  
- **Volatility**: Both DRAM and SRAM are volatile, meaning they lose their data when power is turned off. However, SRAM retains its data as long as power is supplied, while DRAM needs to be refreshed periodically even when powered on.

### 2.b. Comparison Table

| Feature/Characteristic | DRAM                                      | SRAM                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Volatile memory using capacitors.         | Volatile memory using bistable latching circuitry. |
| **Refresh Required**   | Yes, capacitors leak charge and need periodic refreshing. | No, retains data as long as power is supplied. |
| **Access Times**       | Slower                                    | Faster                                    |
| **Cost**               | Generally cheaper                         | More expensive due to complexity          |
| **Density**            | Higher (more data in same space)          | Lower (takes up more space for same data) |
| **Power Consumption**  | Consumes less power when idle.            | Consumes more power, especially when idle.|
| **Main Use Cases**     | Main memory, Graphics RAM                 | CPU cache, On-Chip Memory                 |

| **Feature**     | **Speed/Delay**      | **Cost/GB**         | **Capacity**       |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Static RAM**  | Fastest/0.5-2.5ns    | $1,000’s            | Smallest           |
| **Dynamic RAM** | Slow/50-70ns         | $10’s               | Large              |
| **Hard disks**  | Slowest/5-20ms       | $0.1’s              | Largest            |



Understanding the differences between DRAM and SRAM, as well as their respective trade-offs, is crucial when designing or working with computer systems. The choice between them often depends on the specific needs and constraints of the application at hand.

## 3. Memory Hierarchy

Memory hierarchy is a structured implementation of computer storage that uses multiple levels of memory to provide both high performance and cost-effective scalability. The idea behind the memory hierarchy is to bridge the gap between the processor speed and the slow memory speed by introducing faster, albeit smaller, memory types closer to the processor and larger, slower types further away.

### Definition and Importance

- **Memory Hierarchy**: A multi-level structure of different types of memory, organized based on speed and cost, with the goal of optimizing performance and cost.
  
- **Importance**: 
  - Balances the speed of CPUs and the latency of memory.
  - Provides an efficient way to manage and access data.
  - Reduces the average time to access memory.

### Levels of Memory Hierarchy

1. **Registers**: 
   - Located inside the CPU.
   - Fastest and most expensive type of memory.
   - Limited in size.

2. **Cache Memory (L1, L2, L3)**:
   - Located close to the CPU.
   - Faster than main memory but slower than registers.
   - Acts as a buffer between the CPU and main memory.

3. **Main Memory (RAM)**:
   - Where active processes reside.
   - Slower than cache but faster than secondary storage.
   - Volatile memory.

4. **Secondary Storage (Hard Disk, SSD)**:
   - Non-volatile storage.
   - Slower than RAM but offers larger capacity.
   - Stores data and programs not actively in use.

5. **Tertiary Storage (Optical disks, Magnetic tapes)**:
   - Used for archiving and backup.
   - Slowest and cheapest per bit.
   - Non-volatile.

### Access Time and Cost at Each Level

- As we move up the hierarchy (towards registers), access time decreases but cost per bit increases.
- As we move down the hierarchy (towards tertiary storage), access time increases but the memory becomes cheaper and offers more capacity.

![Comparison table for the memory hierarchy](imagesx1/memhierarchy.png)

## 4. Cache

Cache memory, often simply referred to as "cache," is a high-speed volatile computer memory that provides high-speed data access to the processor and stores frequently used computer programs, applications, and data. Cache memory provides faster data storage and access by storing instances of programs and data routinely accessed by the processor.

### 4.a. Why do we need a cache?

- **Speed Up Memory Access**: Cache memory bridges the speed gap between the main memory and the CPU. By storing frequently accessed data, the CPU can avoid lengthy fetches from the slower main memory.
  
- **Reduce Memory-Performance Gap**: As discussed earlier, the disparity between memory speed and CPU speed can be mitigated with the use of cache memory.
  
- **Improve CPU Efficiency**: With faster access to data, the CPU spends less time waiting and more time processing, leading to better overall system performance.

### 4.b. What is cache?

- **Temporary Storage**: Cache is a smaller, faster type of memory that stores copies of frequently accessed data from main memory.
  
- **Types**: There are typically multiple levels of cache (L1, L2, L3) with L1 being the smallest and fastest, and L3 being the largest and slowest.

### 4.c. Structure

- **Cache Lines/Blocks**: The smallest unit of data that can be transferred between cache and main memory.
  
- **Tags**: Used to determine if a particular block of data is in the cache.
  
- **Index**: Determines the cache line where the data should be placed or retrieved.
  
- **Offset**: Specifies the exact location of the data within the cache line.

### 4.d. How does it work?

- **Cache Lookup Process**: When the CPU needs to access data, it first checks if the data is in the cache. If it's a "hit", the data is retrieved from cache. If it's a "miss", the data is fetched from main memory.
  
- **Cache Hit vs. Cache Miss**: A cache hit means the requested data is in the cache, while a cache miss means it isn't and must be fetched from main memory.


### 4.e. Operations and definitions

- **Read Operation**: Fetching data from the cache. If the data isn't present (cache miss), it's fetched from main memory and also stored in the cache for future access.
  
- **Write Operation**: Updating data in the cache. Depending on the write policy, changes might also be updated to main memory immediately or after some time.

### 4.f. Comparisons of direct and associative cache

- **Direct-Mapped Cache**: Each block of main memory maps to a single cache line. Simple but can lead to higher miss rates.
  
- **Fully Associative Cache**: A block of main memory can be placed in any cache line. Flexible but requires more complex hardware.
  
- **N-Way Set Associative Cache**: A compromise between direct-mapped and fully associative. Blocks of main memory map to a set of cache lines, typically 2, 4, or 8.

### 4.g. Write hit and miss replacement policies

- **Write-Through**: Data is written to both the cache and main memory. Ensures consistency but can be slower.
  
- **Write-Back**: Data is written only to the cache. Main memory is updated only when the cache block is replaced. Faster but can lead to inconsistencies if not managed properly.

### 4.h. Performance with examples

- **Cache Hit Ratio**: The percentage of memory accesses that result in a cache hit. Higher is better.
  
- **Average Memory Access Time (AMAT)**: The average time taken to fetch data, considering both cache hits and misses.

### 4.i. Types of misses

- **Compulsory Miss**: The first access to a block will always result in a miss, as the data has never been in the cache.
  
- **Capacity Miss**: Occurs when the cache cannot contain all the blocks needed during program execution.
  
- **Conflict Miss**: Occurs in direct-mapped and set-associative caches when multiple blocks compete for the same cache line.

### 4.j. Multilevel caches (with examples)

- **L1, L2, L3 Caches**: Different levels of cache with varying sizes and speeds. L1 is smallest and fastest, directly connected to the CPU. L2 is larger and slower, and L3 is even larger and slower but can serve multiple cores.

### 4.k. Optimization (prioritizing read miss vs. hit miss)

- **Read Miss**: When the data being read isn't in the cache. Often prioritized as it can stall the CPU.
  
- **Write Miss**: When the data being written isn't in the cache. Depending on the write policy, this might not be as critical as a read miss.

### 4.l. Why Cache Works: Locality

Cache memory is effective due to the principle of **locality**. Locality is the tendency of a processor to access the same set of memory locations repetitively over a short period of time. There are two main types of locality:

- **Temporal Locality**: If an item is accessed, it's likely to be accessed again soon. This is why recently accessed data is stored in the cache.
  
- **Spatial Locality**: If an item is accessed, items whose addresses are close by are likely to be accessed soon. This is why blocks of data, rather than individual bytes, are fetched into the cache.


## 5. Locality

Locality is a key principle that underlies the effectiveness of cache memory in computer systems. It refers to the tendency of a processor to access a relatively small and specific set of memory locations in a short time span. By understanding and leveraging locality, computer systems can predictively manage and cache data, leading to significant performance improvements.

### Types of Locality

1. **Temporal Locality (Locality in Time)**:
   - **Definition**: If a memory location is accessed, it's likely to be accessed again in the near future.
   - **Implication**: Recent data should be kept in cache for quick access.
   - **Example**: Loop variables in a program.

2. **Spatial Locality (Locality in Space)**:
   - **Definition**: If a memory location is accessed, nearby memory locations (in terms of address space) are likely to be accessed soon.
   - **Implication**: When fetching data into cache, it's beneficial to also fetch adjacent data.
   - **Example**: Accessing elements of an array sequentially.

### Importance in Cache Design

- **Predictive Caching**: By understanding the patterns of data access (thanks to locality), cache controllers can predictively fetch and store data, improving cache hit rates.
  
- **Block Size Determination**: Spatial locality plays a role in determining the optimal cache block (or line) size. Larger blocks capture more spatial locality but might also bring in unnecessary data.
  
- **Prefetching**: Based on observed access patterns and spatial locality, systems can prefetch data into cache before it's explicitly requested by the CPU.

### Challenges

- **Cache Pollution**: Over-reliance on spatial locality can lead to cache pollution, where unnecessary data is brought into the cache, displacing potentially useful data.
  
- **Variable Access Patterns**: Not all programs or operations exhibit strong locality, making cache management more challenging.


## 6. Hits and Misses

In the context of cache memory, a "hit" refers to a successful data retrieval from the cache, while a "miss" indicates that the required data is not present in the cache and must be fetched from a lower level in the memory hierarchy (typically main memory). Understanding hits and misses is crucial for evaluating cache performance and optimizing system operations.

### Definitions

- **Cache Hit**: The situation where the data requested by the CPU is found in the cache memory.
  
- **Cache Miss**: The situation where the data requested by the CPU is not found in the cache, necessitating a fetch from main memory or another cache level.

### Types of Cache Misses

1. **Compulsory Miss (or Cold Miss)**:
   - Occurs the first time a particular address is accessed.
   - Inevitable, as the data hasn't been loaded into the cache before.

2. **Capacity Miss**:
   - Occurs when the cache is too small to hold all the data needed by the program.
   - Can be mitigated by increasing cache size or optimizing cache replacement policies.

3. **Conflict Miss**:
   - Occurs in direct-mapped and set-associative caches when multiple memory locations map to the same cache line.
   - Can be reduced by using a more associative cache or optimizing the mapping function.

4. **Coherence Miss**:
   - Occurs in multiprocessor systems when one processor modifies a location in its cache, causing another processor's cached value to become stale.
   - Addressed using cache coherence protocols.

### Measuring Cache Performance

- **Hit Rate**: The fraction of memory accesses that result in a cache hit. It's the ratio of hits to the total number of memory accesses.
  
- **Miss Rate**: The fraction of memory accesses that result in a cache miss. It's the ratio of misses to the total number of memory accesses. (Miss Rate = 1 - Hit Rate)

- **Average Memory Access Time (AMAT)**: Represents the average time taken to access memory, considering both hits and misses. Calculated as: 

$\text{AMAT} = \text{Hit Time} + (\text{Miss Penalty} \times \text{Miss Rate})$

### Implications

- **Performance**: A high hit rate indicates effective cache utilization, leading to faster program execution.

- **Power Consumption**: Cache hits consume less power than cache misses, as fetching data from main memory or lower cache levels requires more energy.


## 7. Address & Cache

When the CPU generates a memory address to access data, the cache system must determine whether that particular data resides in the cache and, if so, where. This process involves interpreting the memory address to locate the data in the cache.

### Address Breakdown

A memory address generated by the CPU can be broken down into several parts when dealing with cache:

1. **Tag**: A portion of the address that uniquely identifies a block of data in memory. Used to determine if the block is currently in the cache.

2. **Index**: Specifies the cache line or slot where the data should be placed or retrieved from.

3. **Block Offset (or Byte Offset)**: Indicates the specific location of the desired data within the cache line or block.

### Addressing in Different Cache Types

- **Direct-Mapped Cache**: The index directly determines a unique cache line. The tag of the incoming address is compared with the tag stored in that line to determine a hit or miss.

- **Fully Associative Cache**: No index is used. The cache controller compares the tag of the incoming address with the tag of every line in the cache.

- **Set-Associative Cache**: The cache is divided into several sets, and each set contains a few lines. The index determines the set, and the tag is compared within that set.

### Cache Line Replacement

When a cache miss occurs, and data is fetched from main memory, a decision must be made about which cache line to replace:

- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: Replace the line that hasn't been accessed for the longest time.

- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**: Replace the oldest line in the cache.

- **Random**: Randomly select a line for replacement.

### Importance of Effective Addressing

- **Maximizing Hit Rate**: Efficient addressing and replacement strategies can increase the cache hit rate, improving performance.

- **Reducing Conflict Misses**: Effective addressing can distribute data more uniformly across cache lines, reducing the chances of multiple data blocks competing for the same line.

- **Supporting Fast Lookups**: The speed at which the cache can determine hits or misses directly impacts the overall system performance.

The way memory addresses are interpreted and used by the cache system plays a pivotal role in the efficiency and performance of the cache.


## 8. Block size & Cache

The block size, also known as the cache line size, refers to the amount of data that gets transferred from main memory to the cache in a single operation. The choice of block size has significant implications for cache performance and efficiency.

### Definition

- **Block (or Cache Line)**: A contiguous set of bytes that move between main memory and cache as a single unit.

### Factors Influencing Block Size Choice

1. **Spatial Locality**: Larger blocks can capture more spatial locality, as adjacent memory locations are likely to be accessed close in time.

2. **Transfer Time**: Larger blocks take longer to transfer between main memory and cache, which can increase the miss penalty.

3. **Cache Utilization**: Larger blocks might lead to some portion of the block not being used before eviction, wasting cache space.

4. **Miss Rate**: While larger blocks might reduce compulsory misses, they can increase capacity and conflict misses.

### Implications of Block Size on Cache Performance

- **Smaller Blocks**:
  - Advantages: 
    - Reduced miss penalty (faster transfer times).
    - Less waste of cache space.
  - Disadvantages:
    - Higher compulsory miss rate.
    - More overhead for storing tags and metadata.

- **Larger Blocks**:
  - Advantages:
    - Lower compulsory miss rate (captures more spatial locality).
    - Fewer blocks mean fewer tags and less metadata overhead.
  - Disadvantages:
    - Increased miss penalty (slower transfer times).
    - Potential for wasted cache space if the entire block isn't utilized.

### Trade-offs

Choosing the optimal block size involves trade-offs:

- **Miss Rate vs. Miss Penalty**: A larger block size might reduce the miss rate but increase the miss penalty.

- **Overhead vs. Utilization**: While larger blocks reduce overhead (fewer tags and metadata), they might lead to lower cache utilization.

- **Flexibility vs. Complexity**: Dynamic block sizes can adapt to different access patterns but add complexity to cache design.


## 9. Cache Optimizations

Optimizing cache performance is crucial for enhancing overall system speed and efficiency. Several techniques and strategies can be employed to improve cache hit rates, reduce miss penalties, and ensure effective utilization of cache memory.

### 1. Prefetching

- **Definition**: Proactively loading data into the cache before it's explicitly requested by the CPU.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces cache miss rate.
  - Hides memory latency.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Might bring unnecessary data into the cache, leading to cache pollution.
  - Consumes memory bandwidth.

### 2. Victim Cache

- **Definition**: A small cache that sits between the main cache and memory, storing blocks evicted from the main cache.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces conflict misses.
  - Provides a second chance for evicted blocks before accessing slower main memory.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Adds complexity to cache design.
  - Might introduce additional latency for some memory accesses.

### 3. Write Buffer

- **Definition**: A buffer that temporarily holds data being written to memory, allowing the CPU to continue its operations without waiting for the write to complete.
- **Advantages**:
  - Hides write latency.
  - Allows for batch writes, which can be more efficient.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited in size; if the buffer is full, the CPU must wait.
  - Doesn't help with read misses.

### 4. Hardware Prefetching

- **Definition**: Hardware mechanisms that predict future memory accesses and prefetch data accordingly.
- **Advantages**:
  - Transparent to the programmer.
  - Can adapt to dynamic access patterns.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Might make incorrect predictions, leading to unnecessary prefetches.
  - Consumes memory bandwidth.

### 5. Way Prediction

- **Definition**: Predicting which "way" of a set-associative cache will be accessed, allowing for faster access times.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces cache access time.
  - Simplifies cache design by avoiding simultaneous access to all ways.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Incorrect predictions can lead to performance penalties.

Each of these optimizations offers unique benefits and potential drawbacks. The choice of which optimizations to implement depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the system being designed.

## 10. Software: Matrix Multiply with Register Use/Reuse

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many computational tasks, especially in areas like linear algebra, graphics, and machine learning. Optimizing matrix multiplication can lead to significant performance gains. One of the ways to achieve this is by effectively using and reusing CPU registers during the multiplication process.

### Basics of Matrix Multiplication

Given two matrices A and B, the element C[i][j] of the resultant matrix C is computed as:
$C_{i,j} = \sum_{k} A_{i,k} \times B_{k,j}$


### Register Use in Matrix Multiplication

- **Registers**: Small, fast storage locations within the CPU that can hold data or addresses. They allow for faster data access compared to main memory or cache.

- **Loading Data**: Before performing the multiplication, elements of matrices A and B are loaded into registers to speed up the computation.

- **Storing Results**: After computation, the resultant element of matrix C can be stored in a register before being written back to memory.

### Register Reuse

- **Temporal Locality**: By reusing registers for multiple computations, we can exploit temporal locality, reducing the need to fetch data from slower memory hierarchies.

- **Blocking**: This technique involves dividing matrices into smaller blocks or submatrices. Computations are then performed on these blocks, allowing for effective register reuse. By working with smaller blocks, more data can fit into the cache, and registers can be reused more effectively.

- **Loop Unrolling**: A technique where the loop iterations are increased to perform more operations per loop iteration. This reduces the overhead of loop control and allows for better register reuse.

### Advantages of Register Use/Reuse

1. **Speed**: Registers are the fastest memory locations available, so using them can significantly speed up matrix multiplication.
  
2. **Reduced Memory Traffic**: By reusing registers, the CPU can reduce the number of memory accesses, leading to less traffic and contention in the memory hierarchy.

3. **Energy Efficiency**: Accessing registers consumes less energy compared to accessing main memory or even cache.

### Challenges

- **Limited Number of Registers**: CPUs have a limited number of registers, so careful management and allocation are essential to maximize their benefits.

- **Complexity**: Techniques like blocking and loop unrolling can add complexity to the software, making it harder to write, debug, and maintain.

Effective use and reuse of registers in matrix multiplication can lead to substantial performance improvements, but it requires careful design and consideration of the underlying hardware and software architecture.


## 11. Cache Reuse for Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication, especially for large matrices, can be computationally intensive. Efficiently using the cache can significantly speed up this operation. Different matrix multiplication algorithms can be optimized for cache usage by changing the order of loops and accesses.

### Loop Order Variations

1. **Standard (ijk)**:
   - The most straightforward method.
   - Nested loops iterate over i, then j, then k.
   - Can lead to cache misses if not optimized.

2. **kij**:
   - Outer loop iterates over k, then i, then j.
   - Improves cache reuse for matrix B.

3. **jik**:
   - Outer loop iterates over j, then i, then k.
   - Improves cache reuse for matrix A.

### Cache Reuse in Matrix Multiplication

- **Temporal Locality**: By accessing the same data multiple times in quick succession (like elements of a row or column), we can exploit temporal locality, ensuring the data remains in the cache.

- **Spatial Locality**: Accessing adjacent memory locations (like consecutive elements of a row) exploits spatial locality, ensuring blocks of data are efficiently loaded into the cache.

### Blocking for Cache Reuse

- **Definition**: Dividing matrices into smaller blocks or submatrices and performing multiplication on these blocks.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - Improves cache hit rate by working with smaller sets of data that fit in the cache.
  - Allows for better cache reuse as entire blocks can be loaded into the cache.

### Impact on Performance

Different loop orders and blocking strategies can have varying impacts on performance:

- **Memory Access Patterns**: Changing loop orders can modify memory access patterns, influencing cache hit and miss rates.

- **Cache Line Utilization**: Effective blocking ensures that entire cache lines are utilized, reducing wasted cache space.

- **Parallelization**: Some loop orders and blocking strategies are more amenable to parallelization, allowing for further performance gains on multi-core systems.

Experimenting with different loop orders and blocking strategies can help in identifying the most efficient approach for a given system and cache architecture.


## 12. Mapping Exercises

## Direct Mapping

Direct mapping is a cache mapping technique where each block of main memory maps to a single cache line. The location in the cache is determined directly by the address of the main memory block.
### Example

Find: 1. Physical Address bits split. 2. Tag directory size.

- **Given:**
- Main Memory size: 4GB
- Cache size: 1MB
- Block size: 4KB
- Word size: 1 Byte
  
- **Solution:**
- Physical Address bits are given by the main memory size:
  - $\log_2(\text{ Main Memory Size}) = \log_2(2^{32}) = 32 \text{ bits}$
- The block offset bits are given by the block size: 
  - $\log_2(\text{ Block Size}) = \log_2(2^{12}) = 12 \text{ bits}$
- The amount of blocks in main memory are given by: 
  - $\text{ Main Memory} / \text{ Block Size} = 2^{32} / 2^{12} = 2^{20}$
- The block number bits are given by:
  - $\log_2(\text{ Cache Size}) = \log_2(2^{20}) = 20 \text{ bits}$
- The amount of cache lines is given by:
  - $\text{ Cache Size} / \text{ Block Size} = 2^{20} / 2^{12} = 2^{8}$
- Line number bits are given by:  
  - $\log_2(\text{ Cache Lines}) = \log_2(2^{8}) = 8 \text{ bits}$
